**`Game Developer (Student At Ontario Tech University)`**

I am an indie developer currently studying game development at Ontario Tech University. All video game projects are built from the ground up, from planning and game design all the way to coding (with the help of some amazing artists). All of these projects' repos are here on github for the public to see.

**📜 Project Descriptions:**

**__[🔥 Rise of the Elements ]__**

_Rise of the Elements is an open-world action RPG that focuses on fantasy elements. Fans of the Dark Souls titles will resonate with this game. In ROTE, the player has the opportunity to wield the powers of the elements of fire, water, earth, and air. Each element is tied to a different set of values; fire is associated with energy and creativity, water is associated with rules and obedience, earth is associated with freedom and ambition, and air is associated with solitude and acceptance. Each element is manifested in the form of a unique world, and it will be the player's goal to travel across each of these worlds in search of stones that each harness the powers of the four elements. Each stone is protected by a boss, and collecting the stone symbolises respect for the land you've traversed, unlocking a path to a cure for the Rot._

**Release Date: TBH**

**[🎖️ Sentinels ]**

_Sentinels is a first person shooter game where the user can play a variety of game modes. In these gamemodes, the user will play as their created character and be tasked with completing specific objectives while also preventing the enemy team from completing their own. The action will take place in a futuristic setting similar to games like Call of Duty: Infinite Warfare. During a match, the player can move his character from area to area, strategizing and engaging in combat._
